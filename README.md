Deployment target: iOS 9.3
--

`9.0` was the first version to introduce `Safe Area Layout Guide`.
According to https://data.apteligent.com/ios/, only the `3.63%` of the users are using iOS
versions lower than `9.3`. Of those users, `0.75%` are using iOS version `7.1` or lower which 
does not properly support swift. So the actual amount of users that are being left out by the
choice of `iOS 9.3` is actually `2.88%`.
